* Hello

  I am Chris! I like family time, hugging my baby, tinkering with Emacs,
  learning programming languages, and playing sports.

  Find me on:

  - [[https://github.com/cfclrk][GitHub]]
  - [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/cfclrk/][LinkedIn]]
  - [[https://twitter.com/cfclrk][Twitter]]

  And here is [[https://github.com/cfclrk/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf][my résumé]].

  To contact me, email me at =cfclrk@gmail.com=, especially if you have comments
  or advice about anything on this site!

* About this Site

  This site is an HTML export of some of my [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] notes. Org-mode is a
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate-programming]] environment; within Emacs I can execute the code blocks
  on this site interactively.

  The source code is mostly located here: [[https://github.com/cfclrk/cfclrk.github.io][cfclrk.github.io]]. The CloudFormation
  stuff is in my [[https://github.com/cfclrk/cloudformation][cloudformation]] repo, and some org-mode configuration is in my
  [[https://github.com/cfclrk/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs_cfclrk/cfclrk_org.el][dotfiles]].
