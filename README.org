The =notes= and =articles= directories contain org documents.

The =docs= directory contains generated HTML. The directory is called =docs=
because GitHub pages can only be configured to serve from a subdirectory if it
is called "=docs=".

* Dependencies

  - [[https://sass-lang.com][sass]] CLI
    - MacOS: =brew install sass/sass/sass=
    - npm: =npm install -g sass=

* Directories

  - =articles/=: Org files.
  - =notes/=: Org files.
  - =static/=: Top-level static assets (currently just a SCSS file).
  - =docs/=: Generated HTML files. GitHub Pages requires this directory to be
    called "docs".

* Local Server

  Use a program like [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve][serve]] or =python -m http.server= for viewing locally (which
  makes relative links work correctly).

  #+begin_src sh
    serve .
  #+end_src

* TODO

  - [ ] Create build script
  - [ ] Live reload HTML if I start an Emacs web server
  - [ ] Exclude README.org from HTML export (from site project?)
  - [ ] Different layouts for index pages vs content pages

** Structure and Content

  - [ ] Persistent links to sections
  - [ ] Remove "home" from links on sitemap pages.
  - [ ] Move html-head to file

** Themes?

   Move personal SCSS to a themes directory. Each theme can (and probably
   should) =@import= the base CSS that org-mode generates.

  - [ ] Hamburger menu on smaller screens
  - [ ] Favicon
