The =notes= and =articles= directories contain org documents.

The =docs= directory contains generated HTML. The directory is called =docs=
because GitHub pages can only be configured to serve from a subdirectory if it
is called "=docs=".

* Local Server

  Use a program like [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve][serve]] or =python -m http.server= for viewing locally (which
  makes relative links work correctly).

  #+begin_src sh
    serve .
  #+end_src

* TODO

  - [ ] Live reload HTML if I start an Emacs web server
  - [ ] Move site project into this project
  - [ ] Exclude README.org from HTML export (from site project?)
  - [ ] Different layouts for index pages vs content pages
  - [ ] Point cfclrk.com domain to this website
