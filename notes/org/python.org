* Using a src directory

  - [[https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/][Packaging a python library]] (Ionel Cristian MƒÉrie»ô)
  - [[https://hynek.me/articles/testing-packaging/][Testing & Packaging]] (Hynek Schlawack)

  I am currently a fan of the =src= directory. The main reasons for this are:

  - Ionel's first point about /import parity/; it is important that all your
    top-level repo cruft isn't on your =sys.path= during local development.
  - A directory named =src= is explicit and says what it is.
  - Different python projects can have a more similar top-level directory layout
    and a more similar =setup.cfg=.

* Packaging

** Kinds of Packages

   From: https://bernat.tech/posts/pep-517-and-python-packaging/

*** wheel (.whl)

    The project is built and then zipped up. Building usually means executing
    setuptools, which in turn may call build scripts in the project.

    If the package includes native extensions, they are complied. This means a
    separate wheel must be created and published for each computer architecture.

    The zip includes the source code, the =.dist_info= directory, and potentiall
    compiled native extensions. During a =pip install=, pip only needs to
    extract the zip in the right location.

*** Source Tree (git)

    Every file in the project's VC repository.

*** Source Distribution (sdist)

    A zip of the project source code. It may not include /all/ files in the
    repository, like the =.git/=, =.github/=, =Jenkinsfile=, and tests (but I
    think it can, right?). It must /at least/ include the Python source code and
    files required to build the project (=setup.cfg=, etc).

    Does not include a =.dist_info/= or compiled extensions. During a =pip
    install=, pip needs to build the package, which usually means executing
    =setuptools=, which in turn may call build scripts.

    The installing user must:

    - Have an appropriate version of =setuptools=
    - Have the tools required by the project build scripts

* Package summary info

** sys.path

   As explained in the [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path][docs]], the first element of =sys.path= is often the empty
   string.

   #+begin_quote
   ... the first item of this list, =path[0]=, is the directory containing the
   script that was used to invoke the Python interpreter. If the script
   directory is not available (e.g. if the interpreter is invoked interactively
   or if the script is read from standard input), path[0] is the empty string,
   which directs Python to search modules in the current directory first.
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_src python :results value pp
     import sys; return sys.path
   #+end_src

** site

   Print a summary including =sys.path= and some other stuff.

   #+begin_src sh :results output
     python -m site
   #+end_src

   Interactively, in a python interpreter, =site_script()= prints some nice
   stuff, but it causes the interpreter to exit! Ok for org-mode, not great for
   an interactive python session.

   #+begin_src python :results output :dir /Users/chris.clark/Projects/cloned/git2dot
     import site
     site._script()
   #+end_src

* Class attributes

  Define a class:

  #+begin_src python
    class Pizza(object):
        def __init__(self, size):
            self.size = size
        def get_size(self):
            return self.size
  #+end_src

  Create an instance:

  #+begin_src python
    p = Pizza(8)
  #+end_src

  From: https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2015/02/09/understanding-python-metaclasses/#object-attribute-lookup

  Now, calling =p.get_size()= or =p.size= roughly equates to:

  1. Call the type slot for =Class.__getattribute__(attribute)=. The default
     does this:

     - Does =Pizza.__dict__= have a =size= (or =get_size=) that has a =__get__=
       method and is a data descriptor? (size: no, get_size: no). Note:
       functions are not data descriptors. A data descriptor must have at least
       a =__set__= OR a =__delete__= attribute.

     - Else, does =p.__dict__= have a =size= (or =get_size=) item in it? (size:
       yes, get_size: no)

     - Else, does =Pizza.__dict__= have a =size= (or =get_size=) item that is
       *not* a data descriptor?

  #+begin_src python
    Pizza.__dict__
  #+end_src

  #+begin_src python
    Pizza.__dict__["get_size"].__get__(p, Pizza)()
  #+end_src

* Require zip of github repo

  You can get a tarball or zipball of a repo as documented here:
  https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#get-archive-link

  In requirements.txt, you can do something like
  https://github.com/cfclrk/python-demo/zipball/master#egg=botocore

  e.g. see:
  https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/1973ca9709d41121b45c1a0d764ef6788028c708/requirements.txt#L6

* Strings

** Unicode

   #+begin_src python
     return len("üòÇ")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1

   From: https://hsivonen.fi/string-length/

   #+begin_src python
     return len("ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 5

** Decode: convert bytes to UTF-8 string

   A "byte string" is a byte literal, which is an immutable sequence of bytes
   (integers). A byte literal can be defined using ASCII characters up
   through 127. Byte values 128-256 can be specified using an escape sequence or
   hex codes (see: [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects][Bytes Objects]]).

   For example, this works:

   #+begin_src python
     foo=b"foo"
   #+end_src

   But this does not:

   #+begin_src python
     bar=b"–û–§–ò–°"
   #+end_src

   #+begin_example
       File "<stdin>", line 1
     SyntaxError: bytes can only contain ASCII literal characters.
   #+end_example

   To get a Python 3 string from bytes, you must know what text encoding was
   used to create the bytes. Usually, it's ASCII:

   #+begin_src python
     foo = b"foo"
     return foo.decode("ascii")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : foo

   What's going on is:

   - =foo= is a byte literal (array of integers)
   - For each array item, decode it using the ASCII codec, then encode it with UTF-8
   - The result is a UTF-8 encoded string

** Encode: convert UTF-8 string to bytes

   #+begin_src python
     return "foo".encode("ascii")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : b'foo'

   #+begin_src python
     bar="–û–§–ò–°"
     return bar.encode("utf-8")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : b'\xd0\x9e\xd0\xa4\xd0\x98\xd0\xa1'

   #+begin_src python
     return  "üòÇ".encode("ascii")
   #+end_src

   Prints:

   #+begin_example
     >>> "üòÇ".encode("ascii")
     Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
     UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode
     character '\U0001f602' in position 0: ordinal not
     in range(128)
   #+end_example

* Random String

  #+begin_src python
    import random
    import string
    return "".join(random.choice(string.ascii_letters) for _ in range(8))
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : knMyinMG

* How I Set Up Python

  Use =pyenv= to install python versions, and =pyenv-virtualenv= to create
  virtual environments per project.

  First, install a couple versions of python.

  #+header: :var LatestPython=LatestPython
  #+begin_src bash
    pyenv install $LatestPython
    pyenv install 3.6.8
  #+end_src

  I set =pyenv global= to the latest python I have installed. This is so that
  one-off python commands on the CLI use a tolerable version of python
  regardless of what directory the CLI is in.

  I actually set =pyenv global= to a virtual environment based on the latest
  python I have installed. This way, whenever the global python environment gets
  too cluttered with pip packages, I just blow it away and recreate it.

  Global virtual environment name:

  #+NAME: GlobalVenv
  #+header: :var LatestPython=LatestPython
  #+begin_src sh
    echo $LatestPython | sed s/\\.//g
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 397

  Create a virtual environment for the global python, and set =pyenv global= to
  it.

  #+begin_src bash :var LatestPython=LatestPython GlobalVenv=GlobalVenv
    pyenv virtualenv $LatestPython $GlobalVenv
    pyenv global $GlobalVenv
  #+end_src
