#+TITLE: XML

Some notes about working with XML in emacs.

* Formatting

  There's a built-in function, =sgml-pretty-print=, but it's really slow. When
  running it on some large XML files, it's locked up Emacs for *minutes* for me.
  Running xmlstarlet on the same file was instantaneous.

  Install xmlstarlet:

  #+begin_src sh
    brew install xmlstarlet
  #+end_src

  Navigate to the file in a dired buffer, and hit =!= (=dired-do-shell-command=)
  to run a shell command on the file. Type: =xmlstarlet ed --inplace=.
