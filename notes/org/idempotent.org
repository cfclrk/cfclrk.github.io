#+TITLE: Idempotency

Means a function can be composed with itself and form the same result.

It doesn't necessarily mean you can do the same thing multiple times without
changing a result.

Is this the technical definition?

#+begin_src clojure
  (= (comp f f) f)
#+end_src

#+header: :backend babashka
#+begin_src clojure
  (inc 1)
  (inc 1) ;; same result!
#+end_src

#+header: :backend babashka
#+begin_src clojure
  (inc (inc 1))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3

So =inc= is not idempotent.

* Example

** Side effects

   Elevator buttons are idempotent. You can keep pushing button 5, and the
   elevator won't change anything. It will still go to floor 5.

   PUT vs POST. If I POST the same thing twice, will there be two of them, or
   one of them? The HTTP spec encourages PUT to be idempotent and POST not to
   be. So, if I PUT two of the same thing, there should only be 1 saved. If I
   POST 2 of of the same thing, there will be 2 of them.
