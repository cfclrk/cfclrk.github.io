* JSON

* YAML

* Dhall

  https://dhall-lang.org

  Supports variables, functions, and types.

  Opinion: the syntax is cluttered. Even in the hand-picked example on the
  homepage, which compares Dhall to JSON and YAML, I think many people would say
  that the JSON and YAML are so much nicer.

* EDN

* Protobuf

  Not a "configuration" language. But it can be used to declare domain models.
