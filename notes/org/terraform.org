* Kinds of terraform files

  - state files (terraform.tfstate)
  - configs (.tf)
  - plans (.tfplan)
  - variables file (.tfvars)

* State

  After a =terraform apply=, Terraform refreshes the local =terraform.tfstate=
  file.

  =terraform plan= refreshes local state first, but only in-memory.

** terraform state list

   A brief list of all objects in the current state.

   #+begin_src sh
     terraform state list
   #+end_src

** Get state details

   There are two ways:

   - =terraform show=
   - =terraform state show=

   =terraform state show= is a lot more brief, and doesn't have the option to
   show JSON output.

   =terraform show -json= dumps everything, and then you can dig into it with
   =jq=.

* Workspaces

  A workspace has

  - Terraform config (HCL files)
  - Values for variables used by the config
  - Terraform state
  - Historical state and run logs
