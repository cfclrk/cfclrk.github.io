#+TITLE: Getting Help

* apropos

  =M-x apropos=, then type the part of the function name you remember.

* Info-mode Invocation

  =C-h i= to get the top-level info

  =M-x info-display-manual= to get a specific manual (TODO: bind to =C-h RET=)

* Info-mode Navigation

  =^= to go up

  =n/p= next/previous node (not child node!)

  I find this confusing because many modes (dired, magit) bind =n= and =p= to
  move up and down. Although n/p does work from top-level node of a mode's help.
  Hm.

  =m= Pick menu item by name. Super useful.

  =d= Go to top-level node.

* About

  Example of what an Info file looks like.

  Discussion of other possible formats and proposals to change the Emacs help
  system to use a different format.
