* Python Lambda Function

** Requirements:

- The source code should have unit tests.
- It should be easy to run unit tests locally and in CI.
- The source code should provide a mechanism for installing and configuring
  development packages (packages only needed during development, like =pytest=,
  =mypy=, =black=, etc).
- The deployed Function should not include dev packages.
- The deployed Function should not include unnecessary files (like tests, the
  README.md, Makefile, etc)

Bonus features:

- Test the Function locally with the SAM CLI.
- Deploy the function with the SAM CLI (in case you want to run/test it in
  isolation).

** aws_lambda Function

** aws_lambda DockerImageFunction

** aws_lambda_python PythonFunction

The =aws_lambda_python.PythonFunction= is a high-level construct meant to
simplify the deployment of Lambda Functions written in Python.

This bundles the code as a zip file, which means the source code is nicely
readable in the AWS Console.

The =PythonFunction= construct documents
[[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/python/aws_cdk.aws_lambda_python/README.html#module-dependencies][three ways]] that it can automatically handle project dependencies.
